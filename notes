floating point acception might have to do with the startingPlayer variable in the scum structure, 

After scum struct gets created, it throws the error.


For the GUI:
    - Could use Python (Tkinter, Qt, etc..) and just use os package to run the CPP script
    - Feature a home screen, Rules Page, and the play button just opens a terminal

- Have to incorporate two's!!!


throwing a 2 then playing a single card will seg fault
